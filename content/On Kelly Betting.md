As you learn more about gambling and investing, you realise that a good strategy should not only be judged by the probability of winning and losing but also the size of wins and loses. This gives you the return on each trade *in expectation*.  It turns out, there is another factor to consider: once an investor has identified a positive expectation bet or equivalently a risk-adjusted excess return opportunity, he or she must decide *how much* of his capital to allocate to each trade. This is crucial as a "favourable bet" could lead to ruin if the investor does not manage his capital properly. In fact, there exists a "rational" limit to how much one should perpetually bet. 

J.R Kelly discovered this by expanding on Shannon's Information theory by demonstrating how it applies to any system that possesses the *essential* features of a communication system. Just as information can be transmitted over a noisy channel at or near the channel capacity with negligible probability of error, so too can an investor compound his or her net worth at a certain maximum rate with virtually no risk of ruin.
