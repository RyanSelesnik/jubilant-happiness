As you learn more about gambling and investing, you realize that a good strategy should be judged not only by the probability of winning and losing but also by the size of wins and losses. This evaluation gives you the expected return on each trade. It turns out there is another factor to consider: once an investor has identified a positive expectation bet, or equivalently an excess risk-adjusted return opportunity, they must decide how much of their capital to allocate to each trade. This is crucial because a "favorable bet" could lead to ruin if the investor does not manage their capital properly. In fact, there exists a "rational" limit to how much one should bet perpetually.

J. L. Kelly Jr. discovered [this](https://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/rome/refs/kelly_56.pdf) by expanding on Shannon's Information Theory, demonstrating how it applies to any system that possesses the essential features of a communication system. Just as information can be transmitted over a noisy channel at or near the channel capacity with a negligible probability of error, so too can an investor compound their net worth at a certain maximum rate with virtually no risk of ruin.

To demonstrate this, most start with a coin toss - a binary bet. Its nice and simple which allows for easy illustration of how we want to "squeeze" as much growth out from an investment opportunity while minimising ruin introduced by the uncertainty (noise, variance, volatility) in the system.
